# Refactoring: first example

## Disclaimer: This code is NOT mine, it's from the Refactoring book from Martin Fowler.

This repository follows the example given by Martin Fowler in the second edition of his book Refactoring.

Tried to add all the commits he gives instructions.

My commits only have the refactoring technique name and some context for why we are doing what we are doing.

Although you may follow the commits and code to understand what's going on, it's better to follow using the first chapter of his book.
